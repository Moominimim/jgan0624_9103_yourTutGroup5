# Quiz 8
## PART 1
As our group's tentative choice of project was 'Wheels of fortune', I chose magic arrays as my inspiration for the imaging technique.

I think the magical formations have a unique mystical and artistic quality. The static of the magic formation is regular and complex, while the dynamic is full of a sense of destiny and rhythm.

I think this technique shows my creativity and imagination, giving the work a sense of mystery and contemporaneity at the same time. Here are the four images I chose to illustrate my idea. In combination, I wanted to use the particle nature of the aperture and its dynamic changes, the symmetry of polygonal images such as stars.

## PART 2
I selected the Haukun's code of magic circle to complement my imaging inspiration. Create complex images using functions such as circle, rectangle, polygon, arc, curve and more. Push and pop manage transformations of graphics, rotation of images based on trigonometric functions, etc. to animate changes such as the rotation of a wheel of fortune.

I chose the rotating particle effect as one of my programming techniques because it creates some dynamic and colourful graphics that have a magical and mysterious feel to them, like a magic array. This technique uses an array of objects to store the position, speed, colour and lifetime of each particle and a loop to update and draw them on the canvas. This technique also uses some parameters to control the rotation speed and direction of the particles and allows the user to change them by clicking the mouse. I think this technique is fun and creative to make my project more vivid and engaging.
