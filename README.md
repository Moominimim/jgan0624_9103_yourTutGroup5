## PART 1
As our group's tentative choice of project was 'Wheels of fortune', I chose magic arrays as my inspiration for the imaging technique.

I think the magical formations have a unique mystical and artistic quality. The static of the magic formation is regular and complex, while the dynamic is full of a sense of destiny and rhythm.

I think this technique shows my creativity and imagination, giving the work a sense of mystery and contemporaneity at the same time. Here are the four images I chose to illustrate my idea. In combination, I wanted to use the particle nature of the aperture and its dynamic changes, the symmetry of polygonal images such as stars.

## PART 2
I selected the Barnsley Fern as a coding technique to complement my imaging inspiration. This technique leverages recursion and randomness to generate fractal graphics resembling fern plants. Recursion, which involves a function calling itself to solve complex problems, offers a creative and imaginative approach to making our project more captivating.

As for the Flutter Sort Visualizer, it provides dynamic and colorful graphics with regularity and rhythm, aligning with the theme of magic arrays in our project. This technique utilizes the Flutter framework to showcase various sorting algorithms, adding an element of interactivity and fun.
