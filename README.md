# Quiz 8
## PART 1
As our group's tentative choice of project was 'Wheels of fortune', I chose magic arrays as my inspiration for the imaging technique.

I think the magical formations have a unique mystical and artistic quality. The static of the magic formation is regular and complex, while the dynamic is full of a sense of destiny and rhythm.

I think this technique shows my creativity and imagination, giving the work a sense of mystery and contemporaneity at the same time. Here are the four images I chose to illustrate my idea. In combination, I wanted to use the particle nature of the aperture and its dynamic changes, the symmetry of polygonal images such as stars.

## PART 2
I selected the Haukun's code of magic circle to complement my imaging inspiration. Create complex images using functions such as circle, rectangle, polygon, arc, curve and more. Push and pop manage transformations of graphics, rotation of images based on trigonometric functions, etc. to animate changes such as the rotation of a wheel of fortune.

As for the Flutter Sort Visualizer, it provides dynamic and colorful graphics with regularity and rhythm, aligning with the theme of magic arrays in our project. This technique utilizes the Flutter framework to showcase various sorting algorithms, adding an element of interactivity and fun.
